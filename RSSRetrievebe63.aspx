But as I recently discovered during a scuba trip to Anacapa Island with PADI scuba diving store Malibu Divers, not only are the waves amazing, but also what lies beneath them. Full disclosure: I’m embarrassed to admit I didn’t know there were islands off Southern California. To me, islands conjure up images of the Caribbean or French Polynesia. Clearly I had a lot to learn. Anacapa Island is one of eight islands that make up the state’s Channel Islands. Five of those, including Anacapa, are national parks and their waters are a protected marine sanctuary. For scuba divers, it’s an opportunity to see some amazing creatures in the kelp forests beneath the surface. My adventure to Anacapa was in conjunction with getting an advanced PADI certification with the Peak Performance Buoyancy Course. The idea is to refine one’s buoyancy skills to the point where the diver uses mostly their breath to fine tune their neutral buoyancy, and even ascend or descend, not their BCD inflator. I woke up on a Sunday morning at 5 am and drove about an hour to Ventura Harbor where I boarded The Peace Dive Boat. Some of the divers had arrived the night before; good thing the Peace also has plenty bunks for overnight trips. A hot and cold breakfast spread was already laid out and by 7 am we set off. Anacapa is about 8 miles out—a 90 minute ride. Wild dolphins raced alongside the boat, swimming off the bow’s push. It’s like surfing for them, a game they loved to play as we moved along the water at top speed. At the same time, sea lions appeared, bobbing in and out of the water, much as the dolphins did, as seagulls circled overhead. There were fish about and everyone was hungry. One sea lion caught my eye because each time he burst out of the water, he turned his head quickly to the left and right before diving back down. I’m not sure if he was tracking the fish, or his friends, but I loved that I could see his methods. Then, as if in slow motion, two humpback whales – a mother and calf – gently and gracefully briefly broke the surface. We held our breaths each time they emerged, and exhaled only when the last bit of their Y-shaped tails disappeared from view. Frantically, we scanned the water hoping to catch them if they reappeared. It was our lucky day. Whales surrounded the boat. Water shooting skyward from their blowholes would reveal their locations, and everyone would rush toward that part of the deck, iPhones and Go-Pros recording it all. Even the captain said that it was rare to see so many whales at once. If we’d had to turn back toward land in that moment, I’d have been thoroughly satisfied and called it the “best day ever.” The Peace Boat was scheduled to make four dives that day, and soon we’d join our new dolphin, sea lion and whale friends in their underwater world. Our first stop at Anacapa was Winfield, named after the SS Winfield Scott steamship that traveled from San Francisco to Panama in 1853 during California’s Gold Rush. After encountering heavy fog it crashed at Anacapa Island. All passengers survived, and today, the boat remains submerged and his considered a historic wreck site. Alas, I wouldn’t get to see the Winfield because I needed to complete two dives with my instructor, Malibu Divers’ Mones Abdewahab, to get by PPB certification. Another young woman, Staci Kim, was also getting the same certification and before jumping in the water with our gear, Mones went over some key points with us. He began by mentioning something I had heard about a week earlier when I audited an advanced class for diving instructors at Malibu Divers. The PADI Course Director, Grant Graves, had pioneered a course he called Precision Diving, which, among other things, has a section devoted entirely to breathing. Since PPB is all about utilizing the breath to achieve perfect buoyancy, Grant’s class came in handy. Mones stressed Grant’s words of using breath like singers do: breathe in to the diaphragm first, followed by the chest. Most people only breathe from the top part of their lungs. By using this technique, the breath storage space is used to its full capacity. (For more information about Precision Diving, visit Grant’s website at www.precisiondiving.com.) It all sounds great in theory, but on that first dive with Mones and Staci, I felt like a baby foal trying to stand up for the first time, but constantly collapsing. On the exhale, I sank too quickly and crashed to the bottom, stirring up silt and ruining visibility. Then I inhaled too deeply and found myself rising to the surface without being able to stop. Things were not going well. But Mones understood that during the first dive, I had to learn to get out of my own way. People (ie: me) can think too much about technique and get caught up in the minutiae. It’s like trying to remember what the instructional golf tape said about your swing when you’re out on the fairway. Instead of hitting the ball, you overthink it and duff. Same with diving: If you just swim around a little and get out of your head, you’ll find yourself naturally applying the technique. With practice, it will become second nature. Our next stop at Anacapa was known as Trash Dump, or Garbage Cove. Awful name, but I swear there’s no trash here at all. What happened was in the early 20th Century when construction began on the island’s lighthouse, it was decided that excess building materials would be shoved in to a natural depression or cove area. That’s no longer done today, knowing what we know now, and looking at the site you’d never suspect what it had once been used for. Staci and I suited up and went in for dive two and this time, things began to click. I was starting to master that two second delay between inhaling and exhaling and was able to control myself more accurately. Just by using my breath, I hovered for 90 seconds without rising or falling. Doing that successfully is one of the critical tests in dive two for passing the PPB course. While floating, a three-foot kelp bass swam right by me, staring at me as if approving of my technique. This was a good sign because by hovering nonchalantly, I was not a threat to the ocean life and it didn’t mind me being in its space. Back on the Peace Boat, lunch was served in the form of lasagna and salad while Mones beamed like a proud parent because Staci and I were well on our way. With two dives left to go, Staci and I wanted Mones to continue to work with us on refining our PPB skills in a fun dive setting where we’d also take in our amazing surroundings, something we didn’t do too much on the first two dives due to the course requirements. Staying at Garbage Cove, Mones, Staci, and I explored the kelp forests that are so common in the California waters. I saw orange garibaldi fish and marveled at their magnificent fluorescence. All of a sudden, I spotted a giant seas bass that was about 7 feet long. It looked prehistoric, and I imagined being in a movie mash-up of Jurassic Park and Water World. The giant sea bass moved slowly and I decided to follow it. Without even thinking about it, my buoyancy was perfect. I hovered at the same level as the giant sea bass and it seemed to accept me as one of its own. I moved through the kelp forest, following it with ease, because the PPB course taught me how to be properly streamlined. I made no sudden jerky movements to freak out the fish and all my gear was properly tucked in to place without any dangling. The giant sea bass, with me trailing, entered a clearing in the kelp forest. There I saw another massive giant sea bass, chilling out like it had just smoked a joint. It saw me and didn’t budge one bit. Did that first giant sea bass led me to their secret hideaway so the three of us could hang out? Because that’s exactly we did and it felt awesome! I was one with the fish. I WAS a giant sea bass. By doing nothing with those giant sea bass, I did everything a peak performance diver does. My new found skills helped create for myself an underwater hangout experience with a couple of locals, which never would have happened had I not taken the PPB course. This is what diving is all about. The final dive was pretty much a piece of cake. The Peace Boat moved to an area called The Canyon, and Mones, Staci and I discovered that the entire ocean bottom was covered in sand dollars with their pretty petal-like patterns. Once we found an empty patch of sandy bottom, Mones had Staci and I do one last exercise, strictly for fun. We removed our fins and walked around, slowly, almost as if we were walking through heavy sludge. We looked like those astronauts walking on the moon, nearly weightless. After moon walking—forward, not backward—for a bit, we put our fins back on and cruised around some more before surfacing. It was time to head back to Ventura Harbor. For the boat ride home, fresh baked brownies with sides of ice cream, whipped cream, chocolate and caramel sauces, were served. The sun headed for the western horizon. My goal is to always go to bed smarter than when I woke up. Mission accomplished. I could fall asleep knowing I had a new PADI certification, and had become a better diver. I hung out with giant fish I didn’t know existed. But most eye-opening was realizing just how much Southern California has to offer scuba divers. Too bad the Beach Boys never sang about that.

It is so easy in these first, warmer days, to become casual about water safety, and perhaps not be as alert or mindful. Sadly, drownings often occur in large groups of people, where victims perish within sight of onlookers, such as the recent drowning of a 3 year old boy left unattended at a backyard pool in Valencia. According to the WHO, World Health Organization, drowning is the 3rd leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury-related deaths.
There are an estimated 372,000 annual drowning deaths worldwide. In a recent Slate article, former Coast Guard rescue swimmer Mario Vittone said these kinds of drownings occur because most people have no idea what drowning actually looks like. It is not the violent thrashing we see on television. A drowning victim cannot always yell or wave his arms to signal that he is in trouble. In fact, a swimmer on the verge of going under may even look deceptively calm. Part of becoming a PADI Rescue Diver is learning to recognize the signs of drowning. According to Vittone, a drowning person can look like this: "Head low in the water, mouth at water level Head tilted back with mouth open Eyes glassy and empty, unable to focus Eyes closed Hair over forehead or eyes Not using legs—vertical Hyperventilating or gasping Trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway Trying to roll over on the back Appear to be climbing an invisible ladder" And these are only some of the signs. If you are a SCUBA diving parent or any SCUBA diver, or even if you just find yourself in the water often, and have been thinking about taking a course in water safety, perhaps now is the time. A rescue diver course is not just for SCUBA professionals, although our program will earn you a PADI Rescue Diver certification. You need to have at least PADI Adventure Diver certification (including navigation as one dive) or non-PADI equivalent level. Open Water divers are also welcome to participate in the pool training session and if it’s been over one year, it's time for a Rescue diver refresher. Come join us for a refresher! In our Rescue Diver course, we cover rescue skills such as Diver Stress, Tired Diver, and Situation Assessment. Not only that, but we also cover EFR, Emergency First Response (CPR &amp; First Aid) training as well for our class. It is required because we believe in producing prepared, knowledgeable, and confident rescue divers. Check out this latest story about a good Samaritan who performed CPR and saved two drowning victims one week after he learned how to do CPR. Of course, prevention of drowning is paramount, but knowing what to do and acting have shown that victims who receive immediate resuscitation from bystanders – before the arrival of
medical personnel – have improved outcomes.

</h3>
<div><strong><em>Los Angeles, CA – April 26, 2015 - </em></strong>As temperatures rise and kids prepare for spring break and summer vacations, families are heading out on the water for fun in the sun as the season begins. It is so easy in these first, warmer days, to become casual about water safety, and perhaps not be as alert or mindful.
<br />
  <br />
Sadly, drownings often occur in large groups of people, where victims perish within sight of onlookers, such as the recent drowning of a <a href="http://www.dailynews.com/general-news/20150407/3-year-old-valencia-boy-dies-after-accidental-drowning-in-home-pool" target="_blank" title="Valencia drowning">3 year old boy</a> left unattended at a backyard pool in Valencia.  According to the <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs347/en/" target="_blank" title="Drowning Facts">WHO, World Health Organization</a>, drowning is the 3rd leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide, accounting for 7% of all injury-related deaths.
There are an estimated 372,000 annual drowning deaths worldwide.  In a recent <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/family/2013/06/rescuing_drowning_children_how_to_know_when_someone_is_in_trouble_in_the.html" target="_blank" title="What drowning looks like">Slate article</a>, former Coast Guard rescue swimmer Mario Vittone said these kinds of drownings occur because most people have no idea what drowning actually looks like.
</div>
<div><span style="text-align: left;"> </span></div>
<div><span style="text-align: left;">It is not the violent thrashing we see on television. A drowning victim cannot always yell or wave his arms to signal that he is in trouble. In fact, a swimmer on the verge of going under may even look deceptively calm.</span></div>
<div><span style="text-align: left;">  </span></div>
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Part of becoming a <a href="http://www.malibudivers.com/sections/rescue-diver" target="_blank" title="PADI Rescue Diver">PADI Rescue Diver</a> is learning to recognize the signs of drowning. According to Vittone, a drowning person can look like this:
<span id="docs-internal-guid-f5b7c6fb-f8aa-afe2-5b44-b97994e11969"><br />
</span></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
<ul style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;">
    <li>"Head low in the water, mouth at water level </li>
    <li>Head tilted back with mouth open  </li>
    <li>Eyes glassy and empty, unable to focus  </li>
    <li>Eyes closed  </li>
    <li>Hair over forehead or eyes  </li>
    <li>Not using legs—vertical </li>
    <li>Hyperventilating or gasping  </li>
    <li>Trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway  </li>
    <li>Trying to roll over on the back  </li>
    <li>Appear to be climbing an invisible ladder" </li>
</ul>
<div>  </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">And these are only some of the signs. If you are a SCUBA diving parent or any SCUBA diver, or even if you just find yourself in the water often, and have been thinking about taking a course in water safety, perhaps now is the time. A rescue diver course is not just for SCUBA professionals, although our program will earn you a PADI Rescue Diver certification.  You need to have at least <a href="http://www.malibudivers.com/sections/adventure-diver" target="_blank" title="Adventure Diver">PADI Adventure Diver certification</a> (including navigation as one dive) or non-PADI equivalent level.  Open Water divers are also welcome to participate in the pool training session and if it’s been over one year, it's time for a Rescue diver refresher. Come join us for a refresher! </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">  </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">In our Rescue Diver course, we cover rescue skills such as Diver Stress, Tired Diver, and Situation Assessment. Not only that, but we also cover <a href="http://www.malibudivers.com/sections/efr-emergency-first-response" target="_blank" title="EFR">EFR, Emergency First Response</a> (CPR & First Aid) training as well for our class.

From the blare of your alarm clock in the morning, to traffic with its noise and frustration, the news tearing at you, your cell phone ringing. . .and that’s all before your work day even begins. Even when we “get away”, these days, it’s hard to get away. We are always connected to our phones, computers, and the pressures that come with life. There is one place though, where very little of the surface world can touch us. It’s under the sea. Under the Sea - Swim with the Giant Sunfish
It is truly a world all its own. The first thing you may notice is the near silence under water. All the noises you are used to are gone and there is peace. You choose your speed. Swim along with the fish or stay still and observe the unique world going on around you. Learn to glide like a stingray or frolic like a sea lion. Or stay still and marvel at what you thought was kelp, but now realize is a camouflaged kelp fish. Even the Giant Sunfish can be found off our coast and off our Malibu beaches. We, at Malibu Divers, love the sea, we marvel at it, we learn from it and we want all of our passion to rub off on you, as you learn and dive with us. SCUBA diving (and freediving) creates a unique and special bond between you and your buddy. Sharing the excitement of what you have experienced underwater brings families and friends closer together and gives you something to reminisce about for years to come. Each new trip, each new dive adds to a growing and ever changing list of shared sightings, adventures and experiences. So, if you have that husband or wife or friend who can’t seem to get away from the office, even when they are away from the office - even when they are on vacation. Or friends who are constantly checking their phones when you are trying out that great new restaurant together. Maybe the time is right to try scuba diving. There are no cell towers or internet connections in the water.
So, truly get away from it all and come dive with us.

Flood waters resulting from the thaw of the last ice age now fill basins that once supported the homes of past civilizations. Caves which thousands of years ago may have provided shelter from the elements now often safely keep the remains of long dead people in watery seclusion. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but seeing something with your own eyes is much more likely to give you the right words. In the case of Naia, the 12000+ year old remains of a teenage girl found in a cave in the Yucatan Peninsula in 2007, diving scientists were able to see the scope of the cave with their own eyes. They could see how her skeleton lay in relation to animal bones found in the same location. They saw first hand how the chamber most likely filled with brackish water and what that meant for artifact movement. Photos, while great, can never replace first hand experience when putting together the puzzle of events that occurred long ago. The water in Naia's cave also preserved her remains far better than anyone expected. Although her bones were mineralized, Naia has proved to be the oldest skeleton found in the New World. She is also the most complete and genetically intact example of early American people found. Naia even had teeth unlike other early American remains. The Naia discovery is a game changer in understanding the migration pattern of and where the first Americans came from. Our Channel Islands has been and continues to be an important contribution to this mystery with thousands of archaeological sites and important discoveries including the Pygmy Mammal found recently in 1994 and Arlington Springs woman in 1959, both at Santa Rosa Island. Collecting Naia's bones correctly in order to avoid contamination was vital to later testing. Scientists on the dive were able to ensure that proper protocols were maintained instead of trusting others to follow procedure. Floret mineral deposits that might have been destroyed by less knowledgeable hands backed up carbon dating of Naia's tooth enamel to find her age. The tooth enamel alone was not solidly conclusive because of potential mineralization. The secondary test of the florets added needed weight to the findings. Mitochondrial DNA found deep within Naia's molars was also tested proving that her people had descended from the same line as later Native Americans despite differences in cranial structure. This testing gave scientists another link in the chain of proof linking early settlers who crossed the Bering land bridge from Siberia to modern Native Americans. These tests were only made possible by SCUBA divers with the expertise needed to perform a very tricky dive involving multiple passage levels. Cave diving is difficult and requires professional training. Knowing how to swim through very deep, dark tunnels and handle extra gear throughout the process are just two reasons that novice divers should never attempt cave exploration. Fatalities still occur each year, but training greatly lessens the risk. Today's underwater scientists need to have a variety of tools at their disposal that may seem unrelated to their field of study at first glance.

Take Your Passion One Step Further: Become a Rescue Diver</title><description>No Regrets on Being A Prepared Diver Los Angeles, CA – March 20, 2015 - You've splashed off the Oil platforms Eureka, Elly and Ellen, explored the wreck of the A.C.E. drum seiner, and dived Casino Point at Catalina Island so many times you're more use to kelp than trees. Whether you do most of your dives near home, or save it for Cabo, you've seen a little bit of everything by now. New dive sites just aren't the challenge they were when you started; so now it's time to go a little further - train to become a Rescue Diver. It's a challenging, demanding course, but there isn't a single certified Rescue Diver who regrets having taken the course. Realistically, diving is a very safe sport, but much like other nature sports, like mountain climbing or hiking, a small issue can quickly become a much larger one, due to the environment. While careful planning and approaching issues calmly are important, being prepared for unforeseen circumstances and knowing how to help others can help you save a life one day. With the rescue diver course, you'll learn how to recognize and assist divers in need, no matter the situation. The largest issues typically involve panicking, unconscious, or otherwise unresponsive divers, all of which can prove to be a very daunting task for the unprepared rescuer. The rescue diver course provides the instruction and practice, you need to be comfortable and confident when helping a panicking or unconscious diver establish positive buoyancy, calming them, and getting them out of the water, and if necessary, performing rescue breaths while in the water, and CPR when on land or boat. You need to be a certified PADI Advanced Open Water Diver (or Adventure Diver with a navigation dive). While you also need to be have a current first aid and CPR training certification to take the Rescue Diver course, we include that training as part of our course. It's also recommended that you've taken the Emergency Oxygen Provider and the Divers Alert Network (D.A.N) Diving Emergency Management Provider Program (DEMP) courses as well. If you're already an Advanced Open Water Diver, make this the next step in your diving journey. If you've just joined our great sport, or you're planning to start diving more seriously, make reaching Rescue Diver a goal to shoot for. Like any adventure sport, scuba diving has its risks - but with proper planning and preparation, it's one of the safest activities around. Contact us to register for one of our Rescue Diver courses and take the next step on your journey towards Master Scuba Diver.</description><link>http://www.malibudivers.com/RSSRetrieve.aspx?ID=19575&amp;A=Link&amp;ObjectID=1399267&amp;ObjectType=56&amp;O=http%253a%252f%252fwww.malibudivers.com%252f_blog%252fMalibu_Divers%252fpost%252flove-diving-take-your-passion-one-step-further-become-a-rescue-diver%252f</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.malibudivers.com/_blog/Malibu_Divers/post/love-diving-take-your-passion-one-step-further-become-a-rescue-diver/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Mar 2015 18:06:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="text-align: justify;">

The history of these devices can be traced from the earliest analogue dive computers, or decompression meters, manufactured in Italy in the late 1950’s, through the most advanced digital dive computers of the current age: Air-integrated dive computers. Carter Crary, aka Ernesto Barracuda, is an owner, CEO, and master instructor at Malibu Divers. He’s been diving since 1966, and having had the opportunity to experiment with and rely on all kinds of dive tech over the years, he now prefers an air-integrated dive computer for teaching, hunting, and recreational diving. He suggests, with a new breed of integrated computer fresh on the market, if you’re still using an independent computer, now is the time to upgrade for a safer diving experience.
The Professional Association of Diving Instructors, or PADI, defines a safety stop as: “3 minutes at 5 meters/15 feet” and recommends it be taken, “At the end of all dives whenever possible, regardless of depth or duration.” They also recommend surfacing with at least 500 PSI still in your tank. Air-integrated computers were designed with these goals in mind. In addition to giving you remaining no decompression time, direction, depth, bottom time, and water temperature, they are tune-able to your particular gas mix and communicate with your tank via a small transmitter that mounts to the first stage of the regulator. Barracuda espouses the many advantages to these dive computers; the primary one being their ability to calculate not just the amount of air left in your tank, but your rate of air consumption. This eliminates the need to carry and repeatedly check an analogue submersible pressure gauge then guess at how long your air will last. Integrated computers can tell you how much time you have left on your dive and allow you to set alarms for yourself; at 700 psi remaining for instance, to make sure you get a warning that it's time to start heading up to that 3-minute/15-foot safety stop.
Barracuda currently employs two different integrated dive computers; one for local diving and the other for travel. He spends so much time hunting lobster, when diving around the Southern California Coast, he prefers a non-wrist-mounted, hosed computer. For this he uses the Atomic Aquatics manufactured Cobalt 2. The Cobalt 2 boasts a very large easy-to-read display on a color LED screen, it’s fully programmable for tracking multiple dives, and it’s price is in the median range for integrated computers at $1295. He has used this computer regularly for over a year now with zero complaints.
Tourist Barracuda opts for the Liquivision Lynx, $999 plus a $400 transmitter. Unlike the Cobalt 2, the Lynx is wireless and is worn on the wrist. This eliminates one of your hoses, making your gear much less cumbersome. It also frees up your hands to hold a camera rig; tourist Barracuda likes to take pictures. If you’re a parent who frequently dives with their kids, or an instructor who wishes to keep a closer tab on students, there is another feature that makes The Lynx very attractive as your upgrade of choice. The Lynx can monitor the location and air of up to ten divers within 330 feet. This feature is available through the Lynx Omniscient Dive Master’s Kit.
If you’re a budget conscious diver, and have been holding off on purchasing a new computer; which is to say if you’re still clinging to that analogue SPG you purchased after seeing The Abyss in 1989, which is to say you've been subtracting rental price from the total you paid after every dive, and have somehow ended up in negative numbers, you might consider the Suunto Cobra. This is the computer local Barracuda used prior to the Cobalt 2, and he has nothing but good things to say about it. Like the Cobalt 2 it’s a hosed computer. It’s programmable, though with slightly fewer options and without the full-color LED display. The Cobra can be had for a very reasonable $699. With some independent computers still priced well over the thousand-dollar mark, the Cobra stands as a very big bang-for-your-buck.
If, on the other hand, you can’t help but have the hottest new toy on the block first, you should check out the brand new Suunto Eon Steel. This is the most advanced wrist-mounted wireless computer on the market. It’ll run you $1440 plus another $440 for the transmitter. The Eon Steel boasts an extremely durable stainless steel frame, a large, bright, full-color LED display, and is fully customizable allowing you to plan multiple dives down to the last detail, in advance, through its user updatable software. Like the Lynx, the Eon Steel can monitor other divers with the purchase of additional transmitters.
Air-integrated computers are not just a step sideways from independent ones, they are the next step forward in dive computer technology, and no small step at that.

Los Angeles, CA – January 30, 2015 - January morning in Malibu’s Paradise Cove, windless and sunny, I was packed into seven-millimeter thick neoprene, geared up for a beach dive. It was my first ever on the southern California coast and my first step toward becoming a dive instructor, though I’ve been certified advanced open water since I graduated high school. You’ll have to guess when that was. I’m not telling. It’s been that long and, for me, too long to wait to take my diving to a professional level. For professional training I turned to the top PADI instructors in the western United States, Malibu Divers. They’re located just fifteen minutes from my Santa Monica apartment on the PCH, across from Duke’s Malibu; a favorite hangout. Try the “lava flow.” Becoming proficient at anything well enough to teach it requires dedication, hard work, and the right coach. On just my first outing, a Sunday fun dive, I found I at least had the third. Sunday Fun Dives have become a Malibu Divers tradition, usually take place the first weekend of every month, and come with all kinds of discounts on gear. I was anxious about the dive. It was over a year since I dove with giant turtles off the southern coast of Kauai. Even though I was confident in my abilities, like anything, being a good diver takes practice, and I was out of it. Barbara suggested a tune-up class, but I explained to her I taught surf lessons for seven years just south of the Santa Monica pier. I’m also an ASA certified sailor and very comfortable and experienced in and around this stretch of the Pacific. She trusted I could handle myself and the trust was not misplaced. However, once in the parking lot by the sand, when it came time to strap on the gear, I got jittery. It was nothing more than butterflies in the stomach, making me a little uneasy about the responsibility I was about to take on. It didn’t take more than a sentence and a hand on the shoulder from Barbara to settle me down. There was nothing technical about the dive. It was just for fun, maxing out at about thirty feet. I needed reminding. She saw that. Way to go, coach. Nerves steady, my buddy and I dipped into the surf, donned fins, and kicked out to what he assured me was a beautiful nearby reef. Once away from shore, we deflated our BC’s and down he went. I remained afloat. I didn’t have enough weight in my belt to drop; rookie mistake made by a veteran well on his way to teaching new divers- great first step. Way to go, me. Luckily, my buddy was attentive and professional. It wasn’t five minutes before he’d removed some of his weights. He had more than he needed. We packed them into my dive belt and resumed the mission.
It was a wonderful dive, a more-than-worthy introduction to the Southern California coast: rays, kelp forests, reef, an octopus, and a shark; all not more than ten minutes from the sand. Unfortunately, it was over before I was ready. I was gulping air like Darth Vader at an oxygen bar (remember those?). I was down to 1000 PSI while my buddy still had two-thirds of his air. I had anticipated doing this to him. I’m what black-and-white movies used to call a “heavy breather.” I knew I’d feel bad about it too, and I did.
My buddy generously offered to swim back with me, but a funny thing happened on our way to the parking lot; my tank got lighter as it emptied. I picked up three or four rocks, hoping to offset the weight loss, but despite my best effort I rose to the surface. Once there, I found I was much further from shore than I imagined; well beyond the end of the pier. The initial shock of seeing dry land that far away brought the anxiety I’d experienced before the dive roaring back. Yep, I was in the early stages of panic. The journey back seemed impossible- it’s much easier to swim under water than on its surface. I can’t fight this tide with a clunky BC, and a tank, and a seven mil neoprene suit binding me up like a Chinese finger trap, this wasn’t going to work -- and I was alone. How was I alone? My buddy must have abandoned me to swim back underwater. “Why would he do that?” I thought.
Then there he was, bobbing next to me, the second person of the day telling me to calm down. Oh yeah, that calm thing again. Am I that obvious? Reassured, we began the kick back. It took about half as long as I worried it would. You can’t tell me worrying doesn’t work. Everything I worry about never happens.
We reassembled in the lot. It was a good group that day, sixteen or so Malibu Divers regulars, all paired up. All were helpful, friendly, informative, reassuring; well trained by the folks who will train me. Again, kudos to the coaches. We shared what we saw and found, and went over my problems. “I’ll need more weight next time.” No problem.
“I’ll need to breathe slower next time.”
No problem.
Anxiety relieved.
“When’s the next time?” We sat down for brunch at the Paradise Cove Cafe, try the “Big Kahuna nachos.” One thing you’ll learn diving with Malibu, they not only have the best instructors, but the best taste in post-dive restaurants as well. We discussed the next step in my evolution toward PADI certified SCUBA instructor: rescue diver training and certification. PADI offers a whole series of courses for all experience levels, and there isn’t one that can’t be taken at Malibu Divers. In fact if there’s something you’d like to learn, and don’t see it on the calendar, don’t be shy about calling the shop to put in a special request. If you’re already certified, and want to give rescue diver training a shot, just keep an eye on that calendar. You can join me on my adventure with Malibu Divers. Leave your worries at home… or bring them with you. They won’t last long. To learn more, we encourage you to setup an appointment to discuss your scuba career or sign up for SCUBA instruction by contacting us.</description><link>http://www.malibudivers.com/RSSRetrieve.aspx?ID=19575&amp;A=Link&amp;ObjectID=1386907&amp;ObjectType=56&amp;O=http%253a%252f%252fwww.malibudivers.com%252f_blog%252fMalibu_Divers%252fpost%252fso-you-want-to-be-a-scuba-instructor-read-this-story%252f</link><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.malibudivers.com/_blog/Malibu_Divers/post/so-you-want-to-be-a-scuba-instructor-read-this-story/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2015 08:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="text-align: justify;">

Los Angeles, CA – May 23, 2014 - The tween and teen years are some of the toughest for family vacations; the kids are too young for toys and to stay home alone, but too cool for the attractions-based vacations that used to work, and let's face it... not too many people are begging to keep your tween(s) or teen(s) for a week or so while you take off on vacation. They begin to identify their own interests and express themselves through their activities and the first adult interests start to emerge, such as playing sports, playing musical instruments, cooking, sewing, using computers, etc. SCUBA, skiing and cycling are a few of the few adventure/activities where kids and adults participate as equals. Learning the rules of the seas, slopes and roads is a gateway to exciting adventures and each has the cache of independence and self-sufficiency that kids and teens - okay all of us - crave. SCUBA also has the added advantage that most vacation-SCUBA outings will include a professional guide who takes Mom and Dad out of the role of "authority figure" when it comes to instruction and the logistics of each outing. In his book, Closing the Gap: A Strategy For Bringing Parents and Teens Together, by Dr. Phil (Jay McGraw), When Jay asked teens across the country what they wanted most from their parents, the number one answer was to have their parents more involved in their lives, and not running their lives. Unlike skiing and cycling, SCUBA has a firm framework for certification, for all ages. This is part of what makes it much more egalitarian - kids and adults learn the same information, and play by the same rules. (A few exceptions for beginning SCUBA do exist such as, kids under the age of 15 years old must dive with a certified adult and 10-11 year olds have maximum depth limits.) Summer vacation is a good time for kids to catch up with parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts or other adults who may already be certified or get certified together. A good starting point is a "Try Scuba Diving" experience, the chance to feel weightless, underwater in under two hours in Malibu Divers' pool. From there your kids and you may be hooked and it's time to look into the full SCUBA certification options: 2-weekend program or a 5-day courses in Malibu (beginner and advanced) for ages 12 - 18, plus multi-day overnight camps at the Boy Scouts Camp Emerald Bay facility including diving at Catalina Island. A co-ed youth diving club, Venture Crew #130 for certified divers ages 14 to 21, gives young divers the goal of a social opportunity with a common interest. In addition to being able to learn and have adventures together as a family, when children become SCUBA divers they have advantages for life that include a multi-generational circle of healthy-living adventure enthusiasts outside of their school cliques. Anyone who has ever suggested to a middle-schooler or high schooler that s/he needs "better friends" knows that is a losing proposition, and even if you like your kids' friends, but just want to spend time together as a family, it's a tough sell. Learning to SCUBA dive is a game-changing family opportunity that that will pay dividends for years to come. It gives your child(ren) a way to break out of their traditional roles, important at any age but especially as they progress from elementary and middle school to high school. And it demonstrates the duality of exploration and safety - nice things to learn, and in a completely different setting, before they get behind the wheel of a car.

Finding good jobs that you also enjoy are even more so. Los Angeles, CA – May 9, 2014 - The feeling of gliding through a new world, one both older than the one you left behind on land and yet still new. The feeling of slow motion flying, the sights of colorful schools of fish, or the mystery of the darkness of night underwater. Feelings that few people know, but many wish to know. Good jobs are difficult to find. Finding good jobs that you also enjoy are even more so. Finding these sorts of jobs means starting with what you already enjoy doing. If you know and enjoy the experience of a world unlike ours, and also enjoy showing others this world, then teaching people how to dive or taking them on trips into this world might be for you. Let's start with a question everyone has of every job - pay. Pay for a beginning instructor ranges from $26,880 per year to $40,320, The average pay per year for an instructor is from $32,640 to $48,960. Not bad, especially for something that you also enjoy doing. As for location, you do not have to be near an ocean to find a job. Anywhere there is a body of water such as lakes and rivers, has divers. In fact, Scuba Diving Magazine’s listings of the 50 best diving sites in North America included an abandoned lead mine, the Bonne Terre Mine in Missouri, as one of those sites. Each body of water has its own unique features, challenges, and joys. However, while being near an ocean is not a requirement for a rewarding career in diving, becoming certified to teach is. Of course, in addition to there being many different locations for careers in diving, so too are there many other careers for divers than just instructors. For example, a natural tie-in is owning and running a dive shop that sells diving equipment and services. Or that of dive boat operator where you take people out to dive. Then there are the commercial divers who work on underwater structures and projects. From fish and game wardens to marine biologists and geologists to aquarist and animal trainers, there are many different careers for someone who is a skilled and knowledgeable diver who is trained in these professions. Malibu Divers is one of the few places that offers from beginner scuba diving to a full range of courses on Pro Scuba Training, from the beginning of the professional level of training called Divemaster to Emergency First Response Instructor training to Instructor to the various Specialty Instructor programs and professional scuba diving courses; all of them taught with an eye not just to graduating but to actually learning and understanding how to run a business as a dive professional. An Instructor Development Course (IDC) is the cornerstone of PADI's professional-level training that can result in earning your Assistant Instructor rating and qualify a you to attend the Instructor Examination to earn your PADI Open Water Scuba Instructor (OWSI). IDC’s are offered periodically and privately. The next IDC will be held at Malibu Divers on May 28th.

Pinnipeds can stay underwater for up to half an hour. Elephant seals have been known to dive for about two hours. Makes the few seconds that most of us can manage to hold our breath seem pretty lame, doesn’t it? There are a group of hardy souls though, that aspire to make their time in the water as close to what whales and dolphins experience: the freedivers. Freediving is not a new sport, existing since ancient times, although it was more of a commercial endeavor then. In ancient Greece, divers harvested sponges. In Japan about 2000 years ago, pearls were harvested by talented Ama divers who were exceptionally skilled in holding their breath for extended periods. Freediving is a form of underwater diving that relies on the diver's ability to hold their breath, instead of using a breathing apparatus, like scuba. Most of us have experienced freediving when we were kids in the deep end of the local pool, diving for rings or locker room keys on the bottom, but how many people can say that they have been out in the ocean with only their own skill and endurance to rely on? Like scuba, freediving is a skill to be learned, but one that allows you to have the most natural experience while you are underwater. Without the bubbles of scuba breathing, ocean creatures can be less frightened of you, and you will seem less of an intruder in their world. While decompression can still be an issue in extreme cases, most freedivers never reach those depths, nor do they want to, so some of the concerns that go with scuba are not a big part of a freedive. Freediving does not mean that you dive without equipment at all--you may use wetsuits, fins, masks, and snorkels, depending on the underwater environment where you choose to dive. Many ocean dives require wetsuits for comfort and warmth. The equipment you choose will be up to you and your instructor. The freedive training will teach you to control your breathing, to manage your dive time, and how to prepare for your dive before you get into the water. Summer is just a few short weeks away. Are you looking for a challenge above and beyond what you get when you scuba dive? Do you want to get in touch with a bit of history? Have you ever considered Freediving, For Fun?

Los Angeles, CA – April 26, 2014 - The term SCUBA is an acronym for self contained underwater breathing apparatus. Scuba diving is underwater exploration while carrying the scuba gear like a backpack for the purpose of breathing underwater. Scuba diving is one of several ways of being underwater, but is the most convenient method. Scuba diving allows greater freedom when underwater and allows the diver to swim without restrictions. Scuba diving seems dangerous to some, but the danger only lies within the lack of training or disregard for the rules of scuba diving and reckless behavior. Let’s take a look at some of the reasons to try scuba diving. 1.) Admission to a Secret Society The beauty of the underwater world is only available to those who take the time to view it properly. Looking at a picture of the underwater world does not do it the justice it deserves. Scuba divers tend to develop a greater appreciation for the world under the sea and give it the respect it deserves. The decision to try scuba diving may become the call to action for some who decide to support the preservation of the world’s waters and its inhabitants. 2.) Make New Friends Scuba diving lessons are usually done in groups and even if family or friends are not interested in a scuba dive, it will still be possible to connect with others that share the same interest and excitement about exploring life under the waves. Scuba diving should always be done with a diving buddy and meeting others with the same passion will help find a diving buddy. Meeting others with the same interests will provide a constant connection to the sport. 3.) Deciding to try Scuba Diving will add Excitement to any Vacation For a lot of people, a vacation is about finding excitement in life and sometimes just trying something new. Scuba diving is one of those activities that are exciting for anyone who enjoys the water and checking out our subsurface friends and their habitats. Diving is an activity the entire family, including children who meet the age requirements, can do together and the locations for scuba diving can be found worldwide. 4.) Try Scuba Diving and see the World 80% of the world is covered with water and most of that water is ideal for scuba diving. Each location has something special to offer and will prove to be an adventure.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-align: left;"></span><a href="http://www.malibudivers.com/_blog/Malibu_Divers/post/five-reasons-to-try-scuba-diving" target="_self" title="Try Scuba Diving & Learn the Secrets"><span style="text-align: left;"></span></a><span style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.malibudivers.com/_blog/Malibu_Divers/post/five-reasons-to-try-scuba-diving" target="_self" title="Skills for Life Saving">Is Scuba Diving a Secret Society?</a></span><strong> </strong><strong></strong></div>
</h3>
<div><strong><em>Los Angeles, CA – April 26, 2014 -</em></strong> The term SCUBA is an acronym for self contained underwater breathing apparatus. Scuba diving is underwater exploration while carrying the scuba gear like a backpack for the purpose of breathing underwater. Scuba diving is one of several ways of being underwater, but is the most convenient method. Scuba diving allows greater freedom when underwater and allows the diver to swim without restrictions.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><br />
</div>
</span>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Scuba diving seems dangerous to some, but the danger only lies within the lack of training or disregard for the rules of scuba diving and reckless behavior. Let’s take a look at some of the reasons to <a href="http://www.malibudivers.com/sections/discover-scuba" target="_blank" title="try scuba diving">try scuba diving</a>. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">1.) Admission to a Secret Society </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The beauty of the underwater world is only available to those who take the time to view it properly. Looking at a picture of the underwater world does not do it the justice it deserves. Scuba divers tend to develop a greater appreciation for the world under the sea and give it the respect it deserves. The decision to <a href="http://www.malibudivers.com/sections/discover-scuba" target="_blank" title="try scuba diving">try scuba diving</a> may become the call to action for some who decide to support the preservation of the world’s waters and its inhabitants. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2.) Make New Friends </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Scuba diving lessons are usually done in groups and even if family or friends are not interested in a scuba dive, it will still be possible to connect with others that share the same interest and excitement about exploring life under the waves. Scuba diving should always be done with a diving buddy and meeting others with the same passion will help find a diving buddy. Meeting others with the same interests will provide a constant connection to the sport. </div>
<div> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">3.) Deciding to try Scuba Diving will add Excitement to any Vacation </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">For a lot of people, a vacation is about finding excitement in life and sometimes just trying something new. Scuba diving is one of those activities that are exciting for anyone who enjoys the water and checking out our subsurface friends and their habitats. Diving is an activity the entire family, including children who meet the age requirements, can do together and the locations for scuba diving can be found worldwide. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">4.) Try Scuba Diving and see the World </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">80% of the world is covered with water and most of that water is ideal for scuba diving. Each location has something special to offer and will prove to be an adventure. Scuba diving around the world may even bring cultures together and break down barriers that keep some cultures apart. </div>
<div> </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">5.) Choose the Type of Dive Desired.  </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The types of dives include a dive from shore, boat, or raft and dives can include a general exploration of the sea underworld or with further advanced training, a cave exploration. An exciting dive might be to search out and explore a <a href="http://www.malibudivers.com/Wreck-Diver" target="_blank" title="wreck">wreck</a> or observe an underwater recovery. Dives can be done day or night and underwater enthusiasts may also experiment with <a href="http://www.malibudivers.com/Underwater-Digital-Photographer-Videographer" target="_blank" title="photography or videography">photography or videography</a>. </div>

Our Rescue Diver program will be better than any corny rescue movie you watch and more realistic. Do you go diving on a regular basis? Do you frequently go diving with other people? Would you like to be able to help others if they are in distress while diving? If you answered yes to the following three questions, you should consider training to be a rescue diver. Training to be a rescue diver will allow you to have the skills to respond to an emergency when you are diving. It will help you be prepared in the water. It will also increase your skills and make you a better diver overall. Plus, it is always fun to connect with and meet other divers who are pursuing the same skills in a rescue diving class. The best rescue diving classes will also provide you with Emergency First Response (EFR) training in First Aid &amp; CPR. Not all rescue diving classes offer EFR training. Make sure you sign up for a rescue diving class which provides EFR training. This training combined with the other training you will receive will make you a more prepared diver. I know you may be thinking you don't need to take a class that provides Emergency First Response (EFR) training in First Aid &amp; CPR. In your mind you are picturing a class that is similar to every First Aid and CPR class you have ever taken. You can picture the corny movies that you have to watch for hours in over to obtain a traditional First Aid &amp; CPR certification. However, Emergency First Response (EFR) training will be nothing like the corny movies you associate with typical First Aid &amp; CPR certification. Excellent EFR training will be fun and hands-on. It will provide you with the unique opportunity to practice and learn how to provide CPR and First Aid on land and in the pool and ocean environment. The time you spend on EFR training will whiz by. It's a fun and engaging training that will also make you more prepared in the water. Taking a rescue diver course will equip you with many skills. First, you will learn how not to become a second victim in an emergency diving situation. You will be trained in how to visual asses a situation and determine what rescue equipment is needed to help the distressed diver. Rescue diver training will give you the skills to effectively respond while not endangering yourself. You will feel comfortable and confident in assessing any situation you find yourself in while diving. By the time you complete your rescue diver course you will know the proper procedures and responses to help a distressed diver at the surface, underwater and a tired diver. You will know how to surface an unconscious diver. You will be trained in missing diver procedures and will know the proper response from shore or a boat that is to be provided in a diving emergency. Not only will you be provided with this information, you will be able to practice these practical and realistic skills with dive safety equipment both on dry land and in the water. Training in rescue diving will also make you a better diver even in non emergency situations. You will learn more in depth about the equipment that you use on dives and how to maintain your equipment and respond to problems with your equipment. When you go diving with your friends and family, they can count on you to be the safety expert. Rescue training will also teach you how to engage in a self rescue. If you are injured and no one else is a trained rescue diver, you will be able to effectively assist yourself. You no longer have to worry about who is trained in rescue diving when you go out. You can be confident that you posses the skills and have had the practice to not only help others, but help yourself in an emergency situation. If you want to further your diving certification, a rescue diving certification is one of the required stepping stones to becoming a Dive Emergency Specialist, Master Scuba Diver, Divemaster and Instructor. Taking a rescue diving course will make you a more knowledge and safe diver and can advance your diving certifications. Please contact Malibu Divers and join our next rescue diver course.

Los Angeles, CA – April 19, 2014 - When children become SCUBA divers, they have life long advantages. By the age of 10, children are eligible for SCUBA lessons and to be certified as Junior Open Water Divers. At the age of 15, teens can upgrade their certification to that of PADI Open Water Diver. Here are just 7 benefits to having your child SCUBA certified: 1. Instill confidence. Learning to SCUBA dive is a major achievement. Trying something new and being successful will give your child a feeling of accomplishment. 2. Develop personal responsibility by maturely handling risks. Like many high adventure activities, there are risks associated with SCUBA diving. As your child understands the necessary precautions of diving and learns to follow through with them, she will learn to be responsible for herself. She will learn to manage risks in a healthy way. 3. Improve mental and physical health. Psychologists believe that trying new activities helps people increase mental health. According to Dr. Alyson Schwabe, a psychotherapist in Boulder, Colorado,
"Taking risks creates new neurological connections in the brain.”
Your child's ability to think and reason will actually improve as she learns to face and manage the risks associated with diving.
We also get a spike in dopamine when we take risks and have good results. The neurotransmitter dopamine improves muscle movement, attention and concentration. These physical and mental benefits will carry over into other areas of your child's life. 4. Learn a life skill. Learning to SCUBA dive opens dive career opportunities for the future. Your child can pursue recreational opportunities and even future job positions with this skill. 5. Inspire a concern for the environment. As your child dives in beautiful, natural waterways, his desire to conserve nature will increase. He will observe plants and animals in a unique way which will foster a deep love of nature. Scuba instructors are among the best role models for ocean conservation. They teach their students diving habits that will preserve marine life. Your child will learn to notice the impact humans have on the environment. She will become part of the next generation of protectors of the oceans and springs. (Check out PADI's Project Aware resources for ways to get involved.) 6. Enhance the parent-child relationship. Spending quality time together in an activity you both enjoy is the perfect recipe for improving your relationship with your child. Dr. Alvin Rosenfeld, a child psychiatrist and author states,
"Nothing will bring you together faster than sharing a passion. Your children will feel that they know you more intimately and that they have something that the two of you can share for the rest of your lives." 7. Observe abstract scientific concepts in action in the real world. As kids dive, they will learn firsthand about the pressure of gases, how gases react to changes in temperature, and buoyancy (specifically the Archimedes principle). They will learn to apply math concepts as they check dive tables, configure how many pounds per square inch (PSI) their air tanks hold, and to calculate how much weight to add when diving. These applications of math and science will give your child an advantage in school as well.

Studies conducted by the University's ACR Center of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies have revealed that steadily increasing ocean temperatures have caused large reef fish to become lethargic. Many of the fish affected tend to rest on reefs or at the sea bottom, when they do take to the seas, they swim and at exceedingly reduced rate of speed. This discovery poses some problems for the large fish of the reef since they must swim to feed, spawn, and escape predators. Since this discovery, the researchers have switched their focus to determining the ability of the lazy reef fish to adapt to the warmer temperatures. Many feel the abrupt change in ocean temps has not allowed the reef fish the time they need to adapt naturally. Researchers say the biggest worry is the effect warmer temperatures will have on commercially fished species such as coral trout. If the trout can not reproduce fast enough, their depleted numbers will severely affect our ability to harvest them. The inability for these species to reproduce fast enough in relation to harvesting could cause the large coral reef species to disappear in time. On a lighter note, the researches stated that coral trout that spawn in in the South-East Pacific thrive as a result of their adaptation to warmer ocean temps. This means if the coral trout in northern waters can adapt, we could see a spike in population growth.

We will provide you with the training and certifications you need to begin your certified scientific research diver program.

These badges are earned after a scout has demonstrated a specific level of proficiency in a particular field. One of the most popular merit badges is for scuba diving. Boy Scout Scuba diving is something that is both fun and enjoyable for all those involved in scouting. According to an article in Boy’s Life Magazine, “You don’t have to live in a tropical paradise environment to earn the BSA’s Scuba Diving merit badge…eight Scouts from Troop 366 earned their open water certification …for their open-water training, the Scouts headed to nearby Beaver Lake in Arkansas, where they spent two days and completed a total of five dives.” Swim Test One of the requirements for the merit badge is the completion of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) swimmer test. During the test scouts must do everything from swim 75 yards in a strong manner, 25 yards with a simple backstroke and more. All of the elements of the BSA swim test must be done during a single swim time with no stopping. Skills Boy Scout scuba diving introduces scouts to all the equipment and safety precautions that go with scuba diving. These skills help scouts with fitness and develop their abilities for more advanced diving. Scouts will learn about 24 skills including mask clearing, regulator recovery and clearing, using an alternate source of air and more. Safety Scouts need to learn underwater communications as well as the proper use and maintenance of scuba equipment. They will learn how to handle the effects of pressure as well as how to control buoyancy. All important elements of safety will be addressed during scuba lessons. Buddy System Scouts will learn the value of scuba diving with a buddy. A dive buddy can help with putting on and taking off equipment. They can provide help should an emergency situation occur. Scouts are taught to never dive alone. Qualified Instructors All scout scuba diving lessons are conducted by qualified instructors. Nobody should try and learn scuba diving from anyone who does not possess the proper instructor certifications. If you would like to know more about Boy Scout scuba diving we can help. For over 20 years, Malibu Divers manages the largest boy scout PADI SCUBA certification programs in the world at Camp Emerald Bay in Catalina.
